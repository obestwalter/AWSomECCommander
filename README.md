## Configuring EC2 credentials

Use boto to communicate with EC2 and thus supports all the same methods of storing credentials that it does.  These include declaring environment variables, machine-global configuration files, and per-user configuration files. You can read more about these options on "boto's configuration page":http://code.google.com/p/boto/wiki/BotoConfig.
