h1. AWSomeCommander
h2. Configuring EC2 credentials

uses boto to communicate with EC2 and thus supports all the same methods of storing credentials that it does.  These include declaring environment variables, machine-global configuration files, and per-user configuration files. You can read more about these options on "boto's configuration page":http://code.google.com/p/boto/wiki/BotoConfig.

This is mainly for my own exploration of AWS and EC2 - if you're looking to do serious work I would recommend http://star.mit.edu/cluster/
